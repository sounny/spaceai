    <section id="about">
      <h2>About the Event</h2>
      <p>The <strong>AI&nbsp;in&nbsp;Space</strong> poster session is the culmination of the Principles module of the MSS program. Student teams will explore how artificial intelligence is transforming space activities—from autonomous spacecraft and earth-observation analytics to life-science experiments and policy frameworks. Posters are expected to be interactive, hosted online as single-page web experiences. During the event each team will present their work in the Galaxy Lecture Hall (10 minutes per team), followed by a hands-on Q&nbsp;and&nbsp;A reception in Pioneer Hall where attendees can interact with the digital posters.</p>
      <p>The session is modelled after an academic conference but emphasises <em>storytelling</em> and <em>science communication</em>. Posters should engage both specialists and the general public by distilling complex research into a clear narrative. Use visual aids such as diagrams, charts and maps to help your audience follow your story.</p>

      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Team formation.</strong> Teams of six or seven students have been formed to ensure diversity in gender, nationality, academic background and track.</li>
        <li><strong>Poster format.</strong> Each poster must be implemented as a single HTML file with associated assets in its own subfolder under <code>posters/</code>. Scrolling down is allowed, but multi-page designs are not.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology stack.</strong> Use vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) are not permitted. You may include lightweight libraries such as Chart.js for charts, Leaflet for maps or D3.js for visualisation. All external libraries must be loaded from a CDN.</li>
        <li><strong>Design language.</strong> Follow ISU’s corporate style: use the university’s blue and white colours (RGB&nbsp;0&nbsp;20&nbsp;84 and white) and a clean sans-serif font (Calibri or Arial). Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for readability. Titles should be 40–80&nbsp;px, section headers 24–28&nbsp;px and body text 14–18&nbsp;px.</li>
        <li><strong>Narrative structure.</strong> Tell a story: define the problem, explain your AI methods or analysis, present your findings and conclude with their impact and future implications. Focus on two or three key messages. Use diagrams, charts and maps to illustrate complex concepts. Tailor the level of detail to your audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility.</strong> Provide captions for charts and diagrams. Use alt text for images and ensure that interactive elements (e.g. hover overs) can be navigated with keyboard controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Submission.</strong> Fork this repository, create a subfolder under <code>posters/</code> with your team name, add your files and open a pull request by 12&nbsp;November&nbsp;2025. Include a short description of your poster in the PR description.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Storytelling &amp; Design Resources</h2>
      <p>Use the following resources to inspire your poster design and narrative:</p>

        <li><strong>Poster Storytelling.</strong> The article “Bridging the Gap: Strategies for Communicating Complex Science with Posters” highlights the importance of knowing your audience, simplifying your message and telling a compelling story. It recommends using diagrams and infographics to communicate complex ideas and structuring your narrative around a problem, solution and impact.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://libguides.brown.edu/posters#:~:text=%3E40%20Title%20fonts%3B%2024,headers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Guidelines.</a></strong> Brown University’s poster guide suggests using large title fonts (≥40&nbsp;px), section headers (24–28&nbsp;px) and body text (14–18&nbsp;px). Make sure images are high resolution (≥300 ppi) to avoid pixelation when printed.</li>
